This Repository Consists of all the tasks that were assigned to me during my internship at Oasis Infobyte as a Data Science Intern from February 15th 2024 to March 15th 2024

TASK - 1:
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Task Name: "Developing a Machine Learning Model for Iris Flower Classification"
Objective: To build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flower samples into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on the features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Width, and Petal Length.

Here's a glimpse of what I've accomplished:
üìä Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset
üîç Model: Machine Learning Classification Model
üìà Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy score of 95% using K - Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree Model
