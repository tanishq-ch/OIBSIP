# OIBSIP

## This Repository Consists of all the tasks that were assigned to me during my internship at Oasis Infobyte as a Data Science Intern from February 15th 2024 to March 15th 2024

TASK - 1:
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Task Name: "Developing a Machine Learning Model for Iris Flower Classification"

Objective: To build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flower samples into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on the features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Width, and Petal Length.

Here's a glimpse of what I've accomplished:

üìä Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset

üîç Model: Machine Learning Classification Model

üìà Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy score of 95% using K - Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree Model

TASK - 2:
UNEMPLOYEMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

Task Name: "Unemployment Analysis with Python"

üîç What I've learned:

Leveraged Python's libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to process and analyze vast datasets. Uncovered meaningful insights about unemployment trends, contributing factors, and regional variations. Developed skills in data visualization to effectively communicate complex findings to diverse audiences allowing me to dive deep into Python's libraries like NumPy, and Matplotlib.
